    Hello! My name is Aarushi, and I just graduated from the University of Maryland at College Park with 
    a B.S. degree in Computer Science in the winter of 2023. I'm happy to say that I am starting a PhD in Computer Science at 
    the University of Washington in the fall of 2024! My research interests lie primarily in usable security & privacy; cryptography; 
    and adjacently lie in computing education; human-centered & data-centric computing.
